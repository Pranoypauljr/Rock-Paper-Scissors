We use hand tracking module and place a timer during each round at the end of comp will produce its hand symbol
on then screen at the same time take a screenshot of the users hand and count the user's hand symbol using object
detection concept,and finally compare the hand symbols and produce the result,like that there will be 10 rounds.

Python Libraries used
1.OpenCV
2.Threading(for taking ss of user hand and also producing comp result)
3.Time module.
4.Tkinter/Pyqt5 module(for frontend purpose like start menu).
5.Mediapipe-for cv modules but here we are using the hand tracking module.
